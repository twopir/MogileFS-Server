MogileFS::Worker::Replicate -- replicates files

=head1 OVERVIEW

This process replicates files enqueued in B<file_to_replicate> table.

The replication policy (which devices to replicate to) is pluggable,
but only one policy comes with the server.  See
L<MogileFS::ReplicationPolicy::MultipleHosts>
